# ✅ Google Sheets Integration - Updated for Your Sheet Structure

## What I Changed

Updated the CSV parsing to match your exact column structure:

### Column Mapping:
- **Column A (Timestamp)** → Not used
- **Column B (Event ID)** → Event ID 
- **Column C (Email Address)** → Not used
- **Column D (Event Name)** → Event Title ✅
- **Column E (Event Description)** → Event Description ✅
- **Column F (Cover Image)** → Event Image URL ✅
- **Column G (Event Organiser)** → Club Name ✅
- **Column H (Event Date and Time)** → Event Date ✅
- **Column I (Event Type)** → Category ✅
- **Column J (Event Registration/Info Link)** → Registration Link ✅
- **Column K (Venue)** → Location ✅
- **Column L (Publish Status)** → Used to filter (only shows "Published" events) ✅
- **Column Q (Total Allowed Participants)** → Max Participants ✅

### Smart Features Added:
- 🔍 **Auto-filters unpublished events** (Draft/Unpublished status ignored)
- 🏷️ **Auto-generates Club ID** from organiser name
- 🔗 **Supports both registration links** (columns J and O)
- 📊 **Logs headers and data count** for debugging
- 🎯 **Falls back to demo data** if sheet access fails

## How to Use:

1. **✅ Make your sheet public** (you've done this)
2. **✅ Your headers are perfect** (match the expected structure)
3. **📝 Add event data** with these requirements:
   - Event Name (required)
   - Event Date and Time (required) 
   - Venue (required)
   - Publish Status = "Published" (required)
   - Event Organiser (recommended)
   - Event Type (recommended for categories)

## Testing:

- **Debug API**: http://localhost:3000/api/debug/sheets
- **Events API**: http://localhost:3000/api/events/csv
- **Live Events**: http://localhost:3000/events

## Expected Behavior:

✅ **If sheet is accessible**: Shows your real events from Google Sheets
🟡 **If sheet has issues**: Shows helpful demo events with error info

Your events should now appear automatically on both the Dashboard and Events pages!
