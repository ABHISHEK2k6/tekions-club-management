## Usage Examples

### Finding clubs by interest:
1. User enters "machine learning" 
2. System searches database for relevant clubs
3. AI analyzes all matches and selects best fit
4. Returns "AI/ML Club" with 9/10 match score and detailed reasoning

### Advanced search:
1. User searches for "environmental" with category filter "activism"
2. System finds all clubs matching criteria
3. Returns sorted results with relevance scores
4. Each result includes full club details and statistics

This enhanced system provides a much more intelligent and useful club discovery experience compared to the previous mock-data approach.
