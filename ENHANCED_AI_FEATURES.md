### 3. Enhanced AI Service Layer

**Location**: `/lib/enhanced-ai-service.ts`

**Core Algorithms**:

#### Club Matching Algorithm
```typescript
Score Components:
- Category Match: 30 points (if club category matches user preferences)
- Name Relevance: 25 points (if interest keywords appear in club name)
- Description Match: 20 points (if interest keywords in description)
- Tag Alignment: 20 points (based on matching tags)
- Activity Level: 5 points (bonus for active clubs)
- Keyword Density: Variable points (based on keyword frequency)
```

#### Event Suggestion Algorithm
```typescript
Event Generation Process:
1. Analyze club profile (category, size, recent events)
2. Select appropriate event template based on type
3. Customize template with club-specific data
4. Generate multiple variations
5. Apply AI enhancement when available
6. Calculate match scores based on club fit
```

**Templates**: Pre-defined templates for different event types with:
- Duration guidelines
- Venue recommendations
- Participant limits
- Difficulty levels
- Required materials
- Success strategies

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard Integration

**Location**: `/app/enhanced-dashboard/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Tabbed AI Interface**: Clean separation between club discovery and event suggestions
- **Gradient Design Elements**: Modern visual design with purple-blue gradients
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside existing dashboard features
- **Real-time Data**: All suggestions based on current database state
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

## Database Integration

### New API Endpoints

#### `/api/user/[userId]/clubs`
- **Method**: GET
- **Purpose**: Fetch user's club memberships with detailed information
- **Returns**: 
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    category: string;
    memberCount: number;
    upcomingEvents: number;
    recentEvents: string[];
    role: string;
    joinedAt: string;
  }[]
  ```

### Enhanced Database Queries

#### Club Suggestions
```sql
-- Fetches clubs with member counts, upcoming events, and owner information
-- Supports category filtering and search functionality
-- Orders by member count and creation date for relevance
```

#### User Club Analysis
```sql
-- Retrieves user's club memberships with activity metrics
-- Includes recent events for context-aware suggestions
-- Calculates engagement levels for better event matching
```

## AI Integration Strategy
