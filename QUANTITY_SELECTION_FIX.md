# Quantity Selection Fix - Cart Integration

## Issue Identified
The quantity selection on product pages wasn't working properly during checkout. Items were always showing quantity 1 regardless of the selected quantity.

## Root Cause
The `handleAddToCart` function was using a **for loop** to call `addItem` multiple times:
```tsx
for (let i = 0; i < quantity; i++) {
  addItem({ /* product data */ });
}
```

However, the cart store had an `isUpdating` flag with a 100ms protection against rapid successive calls. This meant:
- ✅ First `addItem` call succeeded
- ❌ Subsequent calls were blocked by the `isUpdating` flag
- Result: Only 1 item was added regardless of selected quantity

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cart Store (`lib/cart-store.ts`)
- **Added quantity parameter** to `addItem` function:
  ```tsx
  addItem: (item: Omit<CartItem, 'quantity'>, quantity?: number) => Promise<void>;
  ```
- **Updated implementation** to handle the quantity parameter:
  ```tsx
  addItem: async (newItem, quantity = 1) => {
    // If item exists: add the specified quantity to existing
    // If item doesn't exist: create new item with specified quantity
  }
  ```

### 2. Updated Product Page (`app/shop/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- **Replaced the loop** with a single `addItem` call:
  ```tsx
  // OLD (problematic):
  for (let i = 0; i < quantity; i++) {
    addItem({ /* product data */ });
  }

  // NEW (fixed):
  addItem({ /* product data */ }, quantity);
  ```

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- The `quantity` parameter defaults to `1` if not provided
- Existing code that doesn't pass quantity continues to work
- The cart store properly handles both new and existing items

## Key Benefits

✅ **Correct Quantity Handling**: Selected quantity now properly reflects in cart
✅ **Performance Improvement**: Single cart operation instead of multiple rapid calls
✅ **Database Sync**: Proper quantity synced to database for logged-in users
✅ **User Experience**: Toast notifications show correct quantity added
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't break existing cart functionality

## Testing Verification

The fix ensures:
- Quantity selector (+ / -) buttons work correctly
- Selected quantity displays properly in cart
- Checkout process uses the correct quantities
- Cart totals calculate correctly
- Database syncing works with proper quantities

## Before vs After

**Before:**
- User selects quantity 3
- Only 1 item appears in cart
- Checkout shows incorrect total

**After:**
- User selects quantity 3  
- 3 items appear in cart correctly
- Checkout shows accurate total for 3 items

The quantity selection system now works seamlessly from product page through to checkout! 🎉
